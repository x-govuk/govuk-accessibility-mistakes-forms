Project history shown from earliest to latest updates.

## April 2024

Project was started by Vicky Teinaki (design) and Lori Thomson (accessibility) as a walkthrough prototype. It was created as a password-protected demo built on the GOV.UK Prototype Kit (repository available on the [accessibility-examples Github code repository](https://github.com/vickytnz/accessibility-examples)) and [shared on Medium](https://medium.com/@vickytnz/side-projects-a-weeknote-starting-22-april-2024-4a62c3efae72). I got [feedback from Adam Liptrot and Caroline Jarrett](https://medium.com/@vickytnz/feedback-a-weeknote-starting-29-april-2024-37d6334a3451).

## May 2024

Caroline Jarrett became actively involved in the project.

## August 2024

Project switched from the GOV.UK Prototype Kit to the [GOV.UK Eleventy Plugin](https://x-govuk.github.io/govuk-eleventy-plugin/get-started/) so that it can be hosted on free flat-content sites such as Github pages.

## September 2024

Password protection removed from repository 3 September and moved to the xgov-repo. It had the the following examples:

- complex question
- form fields, hints and links
- information pages
- input labels
- link focus
- list
- tabs
- unique text with repeated actions
- accordions
- breaking expected form groupings

Frankie Roberto added code to help show examples more efficiently.
