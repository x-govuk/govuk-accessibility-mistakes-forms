## Typical example that causes barriers

This example can happen with input fields that include saved information like a username, email address or password. Try this with a browser such as Safari.

{{ example("input-labels/mistake") }}

Without programmatic context, autofill canâ€™t guess as to what the field is.

## Improved version

{{ example("input-labels/improved") }}

Using autocomplete means that any saved fields are more likely to be correctly suggested.
